    <p class= introduction><cite>I was challenge by fellow student to make a website about whatevere i wanted. As long as it design was <br>
    as you find this website to be, that it includes a header where the title is and a topnavigation that follows you down and up if you either scroll up or down
    and that its content is placed in some kinde of a textbox or without.It will look amaturish, since this is the very first webside i have ever made.
    I tried my best and this is what i got.</cite>

      Hi, and welcome to this Blog/website.
      In this Blog I will be writing about anything that I feel to write about, in could be from current events
        or other social debates or ideas to change. It could be about history or other things that I burn to write about.
        This platform will be a place where I attempt to be writer even though I am no were near close to be one. It might look a bit empty, that is because this is just the start. So just expect anything in the future, for you may never know what it will be. May be this is the start of something great or maybe not. Maybe it might have an impact on the social discourse and debates that are taking place in the world.
      <br><br><br>

      Anyways, this will be the beginning of something interesting.<br><br>

      Thanks for reading this,<br>
      And Goodbye!

<h2>About me</h2>
  <p>
  I am a 19 year old student who lives in Norway.
  I created this website/Blog in order to have a platform or a place where I could express my opinions and thoughts
  on different things.
  I am new to this so I apologize if not anything on this website/blog does not work the way I should.
  I will continue to improve on this as time goes. But in the mean time it might look amaturish.
