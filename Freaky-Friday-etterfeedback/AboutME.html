    <p id="AboutMe" class="content">
      My name is Yusuf, i am a it student who is intrested in history and other humanitarian subject.
    I decided to make this blog to have a place to share my ideas and thoughts. This might seem as amaturish.<br>
    there is a reason for that and that reason is that i am an amature. there is not so much to write in the about me section because of that i do not know what to write.<br>
    but i try my best to fufil the standar. even though i am far from it right now. </p>

   <div class="Kilder">
   <h2>Referanser og kilder</h2>
   <p id="Kilder"class="content">

   this will be a place where my list sources and other places where i have found information.<br>
   But since i have not written anything that need reference. This place will be empty until otherwise.
